🧱 Paver Block Strength Prediction
📌 Overview

This project predicts the compressive strength of paver blocks 🏗️ using machine learning models 🤖.
By analyzing features like cement content, water–cement ratio, aggregates, admixtures, and curing time ⏳, it estimates block strength before lab testing 🔬.

💡 This helps civil engineers & construction professionals to:
✅ Optimize mix design
✅ Reduce trial-and-error testing
✅ Ensure compliance with standards 📏
✅ Save cost 💰 & improve quality ✔️

✨ Features

🔹 Clean & preprocess experimental dataset 📊
🔹 Perform EDA with data visualization 📈
🔹 Train multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) 🤓
🔹 Evaluate with metrics ⚖️ (R², MAE, RMSE)
🔹 Predict paver block compressive strength 🧱
🔹 Jupyter Notebook 📒 with step-by-step workflow
